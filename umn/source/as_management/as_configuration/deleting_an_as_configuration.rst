Deleting an AS Configuration
============================

Scenarios
---------

When you no longer need an AS configuration, you can delete it as long as the AS configuration is not used by an AS group. You can delete a single AS configuration or delete them in batches.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.
#. Under **Computing**, click **Auto Scaling**.
#. Click the **AS Configurations** tab page, locate the row containing the target AS configuration, and click **Delete** in the **Operation** column to delete this AS configuration. You can also select multiple AS configurations to be deleted and click **Delete** in the upper part of the AS configuration list to delete them all at once.
