Obtaining a Project ID
======================

Scenarios
---------

A project ID is required for some URLs when an API is called. Therefore, you need to obtain a project ID in advance. Two methods are available:

-  :ref:`Obtain the Project ID by Calling an API <as_04_0106__en-us_topic_0121673684_section86806471133>`
-  :ref:`Obtain the Project ID from the Console <as_04_0106__en-us_topic_0121673684_section11508201712212>`

Obtain the Project ID by Calling an API
---------------------------------------

You can obtain the project ID by calling the IAM API used to query project information based on the specified criteria.

The API used to obtain a project ID is GET https://{Endpoint}/v3/projects. {Endpoint} is the IAM endpoint and can be obtained from `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.sc.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/endpoint/index.html>`__. For details about API authentication, see :ref:`Authentication <as_04_0103>`.

The following is an example response. The value of **id** is the project ID.

           {
               "domain_id": "65ewtrgaggshhk1223245sghjlse684b",
