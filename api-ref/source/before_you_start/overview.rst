Overview
========

Welcome to *Auto Scaling API Reference*. Auto Scaling (AS) is a service that automatically adjusts resources (Elastic Cloud Server resources) based on your service requirements and configured AS policies. You can specify AS policies based on service requirements. These policies free you from having to repeatedly adjust resources to keep up with service changes and demand spikes, helping you reduce the resources and manpower required. This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on AS groups, such as creating, deleting, or modifying AS groups. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <as_03_0100>`.

If you plan to access AS through an API, ensure that you are familiar with AS concepts.. For details, see *Auto Scaling User Guide*.
